# steiner-tree-NLP

MATLAB implementation of a Euclidean Steiner tree formulation as a nonlinear program (NLP), solved using a log-barrier method with a modified BFGS quasi-Newton update and Armijo backtracking line search.

A short methods writeup is included (excerpt from coursework report).

## Notes
This was written as a coursework project, not as an efficient implementation. Performance degrades as constraints tighten (see the writeup linked in the releases tab for discussion).
